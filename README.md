# EDMR

Source code of our work: "Extended deep downsampling network with multi-interactive refinement for underwater salient object detection".   
In this works, we propose a Salient Object Detection network for underwater optical images.

# Configuration
torch    1.13
cuda     11.6
progress 1.6

## Datasets
Our network is trained on DUTS-Training and UFO-120 Training datasets. Tested on the USOD, UFO-120, USOD10K, and the DUTS-Test datasets with F-measure, S-measure, MAE score and PR curves.
